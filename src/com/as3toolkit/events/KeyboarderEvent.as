/*
* KeyboarderEvent Class
* by Joe Pietruch
* 
* Used in combination with com.as3toolkit.ui.Keyboarder
* Augments Flash's existing KeyboardEvent by adding
* two important events:
*
* 1 - FIRST_PRESS event - fired on first KEY_DOWN
*     ( and does not fire again until that key has a KEY_UP )
*
* 2 - RELEASE event - fired like KEY_UP, but with duration held
* 
* You may use this for FREE provided:
*  - this header remains unmodified
*  - the package remains unmodified
*  - you consider telling Percipient24@gmail.com what awesome thing you build with this
*
* You may alter this code for your own use provided:
*  - you give Joe Pietruch / Percipient24@gmail.com some acknowledgement
*  - you consider telling Percipient24@gmail.com what was broken and how you fixed it
